🛒 Customer Purchase Analytics using PySpark
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform customer purchase analytics using PySpark (Python + SQL concepts).
We analyze a sample dataset of customer transactions to answer key business questions like:

How much did each customer spend?

Which product is the most popular?

Who are the high-value customers (spent more than a threshold)?

The project uses PySpark DataFrames and SQL-style operations to process and analyze data efficiently.
